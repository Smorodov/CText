# CText
# C++ Advanced text processing library

## About
I have started to rewrite on Modern C++ some text processing routines and this is the result so far. CText can solve many complicated tasks that otherwise are taking too much time in C++, some of these like lines and words splitting are implemented on higer level languages like C#, Java and Python but not and in C++. But C++ gives much more control and except supporting the missing text functions CText also implements hundereds of optimized text routines. This library can be used to quickly solve various text processing problems, preprocessing for different NLP tasks or just to practise Modern C++.

## Features

* **Modern C++ Template library**: You only need to include one header, very simple to use.
* **Unicode Support**: - you can have both UNICODE and ANSI in the project.
* **Hudreds of optimized text processing methods**: - Many standard and non-standard text processing operations are covered. I have a long TODO list with much more to add. Please feel free to contact me for any requests, proposals or even critics.
* **Clean and easy to understand code**: - You can use CText to quickly start more complicated text processing applications and abstracting from the too many lower level details and optimizations.
* **Portable**:  CText is stand-alone and don't depends from any others packages. I have built and test it with VS2017/VS2019 and GCC 7.4 but it can be easily ported to other platforms.
* **Scalable**:  All text routines are easily to be extended further for all supported char types and platforms. 

## Build the CText Unit Test and Demo projects

<br>To build the UnitTest project and the demos with CMake and Visual Studio:
<br>Load CMakeLists.txt from File->Open->CMake.., after generates cache is completed, choose CMake->Build All

<br>To compile with GCC:
<br>cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
<br>cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .
<br>
<br>This will build a console application that runs the Unit Tests.

## Examples

### Sort lines in a text file

```cpp
// this example reads a text file and sorts all lines in alphabeta order.
#include <iostream>
#include "../CTEXT/CText.h"
#include "tchar_utils.h"

int main()
{    
    const char* input_name = "/Unsorted.txt";
    const char* output_name = "/Sorted.txt";

    CText pathIn = getcwd(0, 0);
    CText pathOut = pathIn;
    pathIn += input_name;
    pathOut += output_name;
    
    CText str;
    if(!str.readFile(pathIn.str()))
    {
        std::cerr << "Error, can not open file: " << pathIn << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
    str.linesSort();
    str.writeFile(pathOut.str(), CText::ENCODING_ASCII);

    return 0;
}
```

### Replace words
```cpp
    CText s = _T("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog");
    const CText::Char* words[] = {_T("quick"), _T("fox"), _T("dog")};
    s.replaceAny(words, 3, _T('-'));
    cout << s << endl;
```

Output:
```
   The ----- brown --- jumps over the lazy ---     
```  

```cpp
    CText s = _T("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog");
    s.replaceAny({_T("fox"), _T("dog")}, {_T("dog"), _T("fox")});
    cout << s << endl;
```

```cpp
    CText s = _T("The quick brown Fox jumps over the lazy Dog");
    s.replaceAny({_T("fox"), _T("dog")}, {_T("dog"), _T("fox")}, false);
    cout << s << endl;
```

Output:
```
   The quick brown dog jumps over the lazy fox   
```  

```cpp
   CText s = _T("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog");
   const CText::Char* words[] = {_T("quick"), _T("fox"), _T("dog")};
   s.replaceAny(words, 3, _T("****"));
   cout << s << endl;
```

Output:
```
   The **** brown **** jumps over the lazy ****  
```  

### Remove words, blocks and characters
```cpp
   CText s = _T("This is a monkey job!");
   s.remove(_T("monkey"));
   s.reduceChain(' ');
   cout << s << endl;
```

Output:
```
   This is a job!
```  

```cpp
   CText s = _T("Text containing <several> [blocks] separated by {brackets}");
   s.removeBlocks(_T("<[{"), _T(">]}"));
   s.reduceChain(' ');
   s.trim()
   cout << s << endl;
```

Output:
```
   Text containing separated by
```  

```cpp
   s = _T("one and two or three or five");
   s.removeAny({_T("or"), _T("and")});
   s.reduceChain(' ');
   cout << s << endl;
```

Output:
```
   one two three five
```  

### Split and collection routines
```cpp
    CText s = _T("The quick  brown fox jumps  over the lazy dog");
    vector<CText> words;
    if(s.split(words) < 9)
        cout << "Error!" << endl ;
    for(auto& s : words)
        cout << s << endl;
```

```cpp
   CText s = _T("The,quick,brown,fox,jumps,over,the,lazy,dog");
   vector<std::string> words;
   if(s.split(words,false,_T(",")) != 9)
      cout << "Error!" << endl ;
   for(auto& s : words)
      cout << s << endl;
```

 Output:
```
The
quick
brown
fox
jumps
over
the
lazy
dog
```

```cpp
    CText s = "Line 1\r\nLine 2\n\nLine 3\n";
    vector<std::string> lines;
    s.collectLines(lines);
    for(auto& s : lines)
      cout << s << endl;
```

 Output:
```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
```


### Read sentences from text file
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "../CTEXT/CText.h"
#include "tchar_utils.h"

int main()
{    
    const char* input_name = "/Columbus.txt";
    const char* output_name = "/Columbus_Sentences.txt";

    CText pathIn = getcwd(0, 0);
    CText pathOut = pathIn;
    pathIn += input_name;
    pathOut += output_name;
    
    CText str;
    if(!str.readFile(pathIn.str()))
    {
        std::cerr << "Error, can not open file: " << pathIn << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
    std::vector<CText> sentences;

    str.collectSentences(sentences);

    str.compose(sentences, _T("\n\n") );

    str.writeFile(pathOut.str(), CText::ENCODING_UTF8);

    return 0;
}
```

### Count characters and words
```cpp
CText s = _T("12345678909678543213");
map<CText::Char, int> freq;
s.countChars(freq);
```

```cpp
CText s = _T("Nory was a Catholic because her mother was a Catholic, and Noryâ€™s mother was a Catholic because her father was a Catholic, and her father was a Catholic because his mother was a Catholic, or had been.");
std::multimap<int, CText, std::greater<int> > freq;
s.countWordFrequencies(freq);
s.compose(freq);
cout << s;
```

Output:
```
Catholic 6
a 6
was 6
because 3
her 3
mother 3
and 2
father 2
Nory 1
Nory's 1
been 1
had 1
his 1
or 1
```

## TODO List
* **More methods for words,lines and sentences processing**:  There are a lot more methods that may be added to support diferent NLP tasks.
* **Further improve containers abstraction**: CText needs more convertion routines to/from STL and other containers and generic data structures.
* **Regular Expressions**: - Partial or full support to regular expressions.
* **Other char types**: - Character types like char_32 can be also supported
* **Mini Text Editor**: - This is a text editor based on CText that I want to port on Modern C++.

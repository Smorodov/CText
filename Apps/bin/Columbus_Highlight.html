Portugal had been the main <mark>European</mark> power interested in pursuing trade routes <mark>overseas</mark>. Their next-door neighbors, Castile (predecessor of <mark>Spain</mark>) had been somewhat slower to begin exploring the Atlantic because of the bigger land area it had to re-conquer (the Reconquista) from the Moors. It <mark>was</mark> not until the late 15th century, following the dynastic union of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon and the completion of the Reconquista, that the unified crowns of what would become <mark>Spain</mark> (although countries still legally existing) emerged and became fully committed to looking for new trade routes and colonies <mark>overseas</mark>. In 1492 the joint rulers conquered the Moorish kingdom of Granada, which had been providing Castile with <mark>African</mark> goods through tribute. <mark>Columbus</mark> had previously failed to convince King John II of Portugal to fund his exploration of a western route, but the new king and queen of the re-conquered <mark>Spain</mark> decided to fund <mark>Columbus's</mark> <mark>expedition</mark> in <mark>hopes</mark> of bypassing Portugal's lock on Africa and the <mark>Indian</mark> <mark>Ocean</mark>, reaching Asia by traveling west
<mark>Columbus</mark> <mark>was</mark> granted <mark>an</mark> audience with them; on May 1, 1489, he presented his plans to Queen <mark>Isabella</mark>, who referred them to a committee. They pronounced the idea impractical, and advised the monarchs not to support the proposed venture
However, to expand the <mark>Spanish</mark> empire and Catholicism in the name of <mark>Spanish</mark> Kings, and to assure a better market position in trading, the Queen gave <mark>Columbus</mark> <mark>an</mark> annual allowance of 12,000 maravedis and part of the newly conquered lands
After continually lobbying at the royal court and enduring two years of negotiations, <mark>Columbus</mark> finally succeeded in January 1492. Queen <mark>Isabella's</mark> forces had just conquered the Moorish Emirate of Granada, the last Muslim stronghold of Al-Andalus on the <mark>Iberian</mark> <mark>peninsula</mark>, for Castile. <mark>Isabella</mark> and Ferdinand received <mark>Columbus</mark> in the Alcázar (castle) in Córdoba to support his plans
According to <mark>Columbus's</mark> contract made for the <mark>expedition</mark> commission by Queen <mark>Isabella</mark> for Castile, if <mark>Columbus</mark> claimed any new islands or mainland for the Crown, he would receive many high rewards. In terms of power, he would be given the rank of Admiral of the <mark>Ocean</mark> Sea and appointed Viceroy and Governor of the newly colonised lands. He had the right to nominate three <mark>people</mark>, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to ten <mark>per</mark> cent of all the revenues from the new lands in <mark>perpetuity</mark>
The monarchs left it to the royal treasurer to shift funds among various royal accounts on behalf of the enterprise. <mark>Columbus</mark> <mark>was</mark> to be made "Admiral of the <mark>Seas</mark>" and would receive a portion of all profits. The terms were unusually generous but, <mark>as</mark> his son later wrote, the monarchs were not confident of his return

<mark>Europe</mark> had long enjoyed a safe land passage to China and Indiaâ€”sources of valued goods such <mark>as</mark> silk, spices, and opiates under the hegemony of the Mongol Empire (the Pax Mongolica, or Mongol <mark>peace</mark>). With the Fall of Constantinople to the Turkish <mark>Ottoman</mark> Empire in 1453, the land route to Asia became more difficult. In response to this the <mark>Columbus</mark> brothers had, by the 1480s, <mark>developed</mark> a <mark>plan</mark> to travel to the Indies, then construed roughly <mark>as</mark> all of southern and eastern Asia, by sailing directly west across what <mark>was</mark> believed to be the singular "<mark>Ocean</mark> Sea," the Atlantic <mark>Ocean</mark>
Washington Irving's 1828 biography of <mark>Columbus</mark> popularized the idea that <mark>Columbus</mark> had difficulty obtaining support for his <mark>plan</mark> because <mark>Europeans</mark> thought the Earth <mark>was</mark> flat. In fact, the primitive maritime navigation of the time relied on the stars and the curvature of the spherical Earth. The knowledge that the Earth <mark>was</mark> spherical <mark>was</mark> widespread, and the means of calculating its diameter using <mark>an</mark> astrolabe <mark>was</mark> known to both scholars and navigators
